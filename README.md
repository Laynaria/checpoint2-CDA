# This repository is for my own CHECKPOINT 2, during my CDA apprenticeship

Step 1 :

- Create `.env file` in backend repository by copy pasting `.env.sample`

since this is a training repo, here are the right informations to match the docker-compose infos:

```js
PORT = 5010;
DB_PORT = 5432;
USERNAME = checkpoint2;
PASSWORD = checkpoint2;
DATABASE = checkpoint2_db;
```

- use `docker-compose up` to launch the repository if it doesn't work, launch `docker compose up --build`
